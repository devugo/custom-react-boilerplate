## Custom React Boiler Plate

This is react project setup from scratch without CRA using Webpack

In the project root, run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
THe above launches a development server that opens on the browser at<br />
Click [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it

Code re builds when there's a change in the code base and browser refreshes automatically, thanks to Webpack

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Run the above for production build which would create a build folder where the build files would be, only run this in production environment
