## Custom React Boiler Plate

This is a react project setup from scratch without create-react-app(CRA), using Webpack. Check out how to do the same [here](https://blog.devugo.com/how-to-set-up-a-react-app-without-using-create-react-app-cra-ckfffzq3400ezzgs1hp67h0oy).

In the project root, run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
THe above launches a development server that opens on the browser at<br />
Click [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it

Code re builds when there's a change in the code base and browser refreshes automatically, thanks to Webpack

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Run the above for production build which would create a build folder where the build files would be, only run this in production environment
